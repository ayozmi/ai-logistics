# Price Predictor Feature

In the dynamic world of supply chain management, the ability to predict costs accurately is crucial for maintaining competitiveness and operational efficiency. One of the significant challenges faced by supply chain managers and logistics professionals is the unpredictability of shipping costs, which can fluctuate due to various factors such as fuel prices, geopolitical tensions, regulatory changes, and market demand. These fluctuations can lead to unexpected increases in operational costs, budget overruns, and reduced profit margins, making it essential to have a robust system for predictive cost modeling.

Moreover, the manual process of monitoring and analyzing cost-related data across different shipments and transport modes can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This labor-intensive task detracts from the ability of logistics teams to focus on strategic decision-making and long-term planning. The absence of an automated, real-time predictive tool can result in missed opportunities for cost optimization and proactive risk management, ultimately impacting the bottom line.

To address these challenges, we propose a feature called Price Predictor, which leverages a dataset specifically tailored for supply chain analysis an enhanced by matching real SKU's from the client's database. This original dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis/download?datasetVersionNumber=1). This dataset provides a solid foundation for developing our predictive pricing model due to its close alignment with the client's actual data. As we progress, we plan to conduct further tests and integrate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes with the client's databases, contingent upon obtaining the required data access permissions.

The Price Predictor feature will implement advanced predictive modeling techniques to identify cargo and shipments likely to incur higher costs. By establishing an alert system accessible directly through our software, this feature will inform users about which shipments require closer attention or allow them to select a specific shipment to predict its price. This system will provide logistics professionals with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and enhance responsiveness to cost fluctuations.

By integrating this predictive tool with real-time data and AI-powered analysis, the Price Predictor will transform the responsiveness and strategic decision-making capabilities of supply chain managers. It will provide predictive insights into shipping and transport costs, helping to mitigate risks, reduce operational costs, and improve overall efficiency in the supply chain.
