    "\n",
    "We are leveraging a dataset specifically tailored for supply chain analysis, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis/download?datasetVersionNumber=1). This dataset provides a solid foundation for developing our predictive pricing model. The dataset's close alignment with the client's actual data makes it an ideal choice for this stage. As we progress, we plan to conduct further tests and integrate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes with the client's databases, contingent upon obtaining the required data access permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this data, we plan to implement a feature that focuses on predictive price modeling. This feature will identify cargo and shipments likely to incur higher costs and establish an alert system. Accessible directly through our software, this system will inform users about which shipments require closer attention or allow them to select a specific shipment to predict its price."
